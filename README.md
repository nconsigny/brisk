Fire simulation results to be presented in a probabilistic form and allows the variability and uncertainty associated with the predictions of the fire environment to be quantified.

- a design fire generator and item-to-item fire spread module allowing building contents to be randomly placed within a room and the overall rate of heat release to be determined
- a comprehensive sprinkler response module including operation of multiple heads and parameters for effectiveness and reliability of sprinkler systems
- Assignment of hold-open devices to doors and open/close vents using a range of trigger criteria
- Vent flows and smoke migration
- reliability of other systems such as smoke detectors, mechanical systems and passive elements such as doors
- C/VM2 user mode - useful for fire analysis required to be in compliance with the New Zealand Building Code
- visualisation of geometry and results using Smokeview software
- Monte Carlo multi-iteration sampling for probability/risk analysis
- the inclusion of various types of balcony spill plume relationships to facilitate the design of smoke management systems within buildings.
